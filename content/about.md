My research focuses on two key areas within bioinformatics and cancer genomics, where I am actively learning and collaborating with lab members. First, I am involved in developing and applying computational methods, including tumor deconvolution and single-cell/spatial data analysis, to better understand the intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), tumor evolution, and the interaction of components within the tumor microenvironment (TME).  Second, I am contributing to efforts in validating semi-parametric survival models for cancer risk prediction, particularly in the context of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS). Together, these areas aim to improve personalized cancer treatment and enhance clinical management.
