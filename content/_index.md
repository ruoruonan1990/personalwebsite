Hi, I'm Ruonan Li 👋. 

👩‍💻 I am a data scientist in the department of bioinfomatics and computational biology at MD Anderson Cancer Center, under the supervision of [Dr. Wenyi Wang](https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/wenyi_wang.html).

🎓 I got my PhD in Physics from Temple University, under the supervision of Dr. Nikos Sparveris.

In my free time, I like yoga 🧘‍♀️, watching movies and TV shows 📺, and playing with my cat 🐱. My favourite food is Chuan (Chinese BBQ 🥓).
